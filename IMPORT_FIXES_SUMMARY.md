# File Import Casing Issue - FIXED

## Problem
There was a casing inconsistency in the `TeacherDashboardHeader` component filename and imports:
- Actual filename: `TeacherDashboardHeader.jsx` (lowercase "b" in "board")
- Some imports used: `TeacherDashBoardHeader` (capital "B" in "Board")

This caused import errors due to case sensitivity in the file system.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `frontend/src/pages/teacher/TeacherDashboard.jsx`
- **Before**: `import TeacherDashboardHeader from "./TeacherDashBoardHeader.jsx";`
- **After**: `import TeacherDashboardHeader from "./TeacherDashboardHeader.jsx";`

### 2. `frontend/src/pages/teacher/TuitionPostPage.jsx`
- **Before**: `import TeacherDashboardHeader from "./TeacherDashBoardHeader";`
- **After**: `import TeacherDashboardHeader from "./TeacherDashboardHeader";`

### 3. `frontend/src/pages/teacher/TeacherBatches.jsx`
- Fixed function name from `StudentBatches()` to `TeacherBatches()`
- Fixed export statement from `export default StudentBatches;` to `export default TeacherBatches;`

## Status
✅ All import casing issues resolved
✅ All files now use the correct filename: `TeacherDashboardHeader.jsx`
✅ No compilation errors detected
✅ Function names now match file purposes

The TeacherDashboardHeader component is now consistently imported across all teacher pages.
